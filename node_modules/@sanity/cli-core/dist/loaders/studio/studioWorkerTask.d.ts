/**
 * Executes a worker file in a Sanity Studio browser context.
 *
 * This uses a combination of vite for "bundling" + jsdom for emulating a browser
 * environment under the hood, which means that the same thing that will work in vite
 * _should_ work in the worker - to a degree. If the user has defined any typescript
 * path aliases, these will have to be added as aliases to the vite config - the same
 * behavior as you would see with regular vite. Other things that are accounted for:
 *
 * - TypeScript support (+JSX, enums and other "compilation needed" features)
 * - CSS, font and other file imports will resolve to a file path
 * - CSS module imports will resolve to a javascript object of class names
 * - Environment variables are available both as `import.meta.env` and `process.env`,
 *   and `.env` files are loaded in the same way that they would in a Sanity studio.
 * - Browser globals not available in a Node.js environment but _are_ provided by JSDOM
 *   are defined directly to the Node environment as globals. While this polutes the
 *   global namespace, it is done only in the worker thread.
 * - Certain browser globals that are _not_ available in JSDOM are also provided to the
 *   global namespace - things like `requestIdleCallback`, `IntersectionObserver` etc.
 *   These are provided with a minimal stub implementation to make them not crash.
 *
 * @param filePath - Path to the worker file (`.ts` works and is encouraged)
 * @param options - Options to pass to the worker
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the message from the worker
 * @throws If the file does not exist
 * @throws If the worker exits with a non-zero code
 * @internal
